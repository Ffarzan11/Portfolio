          Hello! I am Farhikhta Farzan. I am currently pursuing my Bachelorâ€™s
          degree in computer science. My journey so far has been a mix of
          software development and product management, with hands-on experience
          in C++, Java, Express.js, React, MongoDB, MySQL, and Python. When I am
          not coding, I am probably diving into a good book. If you would like to
          connect, discuss tech, or share book recommendations, feel free to DM
          me on LinkedIn!
        </p>
